# Memory Game Project

This project is developed with JavaScript (inc. jQuery), HTML and CSS. Required assigment for Phase 2 of Google x Udacity FEND Scholarship program.

**Player Instructions:**
You could download/clone the repo (from GitHub) and open "index.html" to play the game. A game starts with 3 stars. For every 2 cards clicked, you make a move. You lose a star when your moves come to 10. Another star is removed when your moves come to 15. When your moves come to 20, you have no stars left on the score panel. At end of the game, a popup shows stars remained and tells the time you spend on the game.
